# Energy deposit by heavy particles
There are several types of empirical formulae to describe dE/dx.
Reffered from [PDG 2018 Reviews, 2018 Reviews, chapter 33. Passage of particles through matter](http://pdg.lbl.gov/2018/reviews/rpp2018-rev-passage-particles-matter.pdf).

For simple summary, please look at EnergyDepositStudy.pdf in this directory.
